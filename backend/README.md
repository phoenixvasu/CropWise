# Crop Prediction 

### Crop Prediction Model

This project predicts which crop would be best to grow based on factors like soil nutrients 
(Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), temperature, humidity, pH levels, and rainfall. 
It's a simple ML model that helps to make better decisions about crop selection.
